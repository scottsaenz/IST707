This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

Function for Removing NAs
```{r function Check for NAs}
findNAs <- function(df) {
  # Turn blanks into NAs
  df[df==""] <- NA
  cnames <- colnames(df)
  i = 0
  for (name in cnames){
    if(sum(is.na(df[,name])) > 0){
      print(name)
      i <- i + 1
    }
  }
  print(c(i,"variables contain NAs"))
}
```


Read in file and check where cleaning is needed.

```{r}
# read in csv 
mathProgress <- read.csv("data-storyteller.csv")
# check structure
str(mathProgress)
#check for NAs
findNAs(mathProgress)
```

Change section to factor datatype and review initial descriptive statistics
```{r}
mathProgress$Section <- factor(mathProgress$Section)
summary(mathProgress)
```

Upivot the data
```{r}
mathProgressUnpivot <- reshape2::melt(mathProgress, id = c("School","Section"), value.name="NumOfStudents", variable.name = "Progress")
mathProgressUnpivot
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
